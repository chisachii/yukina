My dream future career is to be an Accessibility Consultant for Arts and Leisure, especially in Performing Arts, Theme Parks, or Conventions. I chose this career because it aligns closely with my values of empathy, helping others, and making a positive impact. I am passionate about creating inclusive experiences, and working as an Accessibility Consultant allows me to combine my interest with the opportunity to ensure that everyone can enjoy the same experiences.

I realised that there is a severe lack of accessibility especially in Theme Parks and Events. At TwitchCon San Diego late last year, not only was there [reports of event-goers not being given the assistance they need](https://x.com/IcedMangoJango/status/1979740290878697950), but even [one of the invited guests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0CT2S8XkkM) had a scenario where he [was not given the aids he needed, namely a wheelchair ramp](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftChampionship/comments/1obakh5/wheelchair_accessibility_at_twitch_rivals/), and this has been a consistent thing happening at this event for years. This should not be happening in event spaces advertised for everyone, and I want to be one of the people to change that.

My responsibilities in this role would be simple. Assess different facilities for accessibility compliance ensuring that they meet international accessibility standards, and to advice businesses on how to improve on accessibility for guests with disabilities or special needs. I could also train staff on inclusive practises and spread awareness for others this way.

Qualifications for this job would include Diplomas or Degrees in Hospitality, Management, Built Environment, or Disability Studies. Knowledge of international accessibility standards as well as experience in hospitality and facility management would be preferred. Skills required would be strong communication and interpersonal skills to advise clients, and analytical skills to assess environments and propose practicle solutions. I would also need to be empathetic and understanding of other's needs.

A role similar to this would be SGEnable's [Research](https://www.sgenable.sg/about-us/careers/job/research-(enabled-living-programme)) role, pictured below:
