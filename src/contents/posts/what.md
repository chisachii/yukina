Through my Diploma thus far, I have developed a strong foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, which are essential for a career in accessibility with regards to attractions and events. Modules such as **Business Law** have enhanced my understanding of the legal frameworks that govern business operations. This knowledge is crucial for ensuring compliance and ethical practices especially when dealing with accessibility laws.

**Innovation Made Possible** and **User-Centred Design for Business** have equipped me with creative problem-solving skills and an ability to do digital design. By applying user-centered design principles, I have learned to design engaging experiences for customers, a skill directly relevant to enhancing guest experiences. Moving forward, modules like **Event Design** and **Service Experience Design** will allow me to gain hands-on experience in planning, programming, budgeting, and curating immersive service experiences. These modules emphasize practical application, enabling me to translate concepts into real-world projects and prepare for roles such as events or operations management.

Specialising in service design aligns with my goal of creating memorable guest experiences while considering broader societal challenges. Through the **Tourism Research** module in my second year, I aim to develop research skills that will help me gather and analyze data to make informed decisions and improve service offerings. **Statistical Applications for Business** has taught me how to analyse and apply the data into my work.

At university, modules such as **Researching the Social World**, **Global Social Challenges**, and **Travel and Tourism** at the University of Surrey will further deepen my understanding of tourism from a sociological perspective. They will equip me with research techniques and insights into global social issues, which I can apply to designing inclusive and impactful experiences. I am looking forward to engaging in industry projects and internships in places across the world, where I can combine practical experience with my academic learning.

Besides developing technical knowledge in service design, I recognize the importance of soft skills such as teamwork, communication, creativity, and leadership for my future career. My involvement in **Chinese Orchestra** and the **Tabletop Games Club** provides valuable opportunities to cultivate these skills.

Through **Chinese Orchestra**, I develop discipline, patience, and teamwork, as performing in a large ensemble requires coordination, active listening, and collaboration to achieve harmony. This CCA also nurtures creativity and cultural appreciation, which is something I hold very high importance towards.

In the **Tabletop Games Club**, I make use of strategic thinking, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills by planning game sessions and facilitating group interactions, especially as someone who plays **Dungeons and Dragons** both as a player, and a dungeon master. This environment encourages communication, adaptability, and leadership, as members must negotiate rules, resolve conflicts, and work together to achieve shared objectives.

Both CCAs allow me to interact with many different peers and apply soft skills in real situations. These experiences will prepare me for collaborative and client-facing roles, supporting my goal of delivering memorable guest experiences while demonstrating professionalism and empathy.

After graduating from Ngee Ann, I plan to continue my education through university programmes that will strengthen my research, analytical, and service-oriented skills, supporting my future career as an accessibility advisor. One option is the **Bachelor of Arts in Sociology** at **the University of Surrey**, which focuses on understanding social behaviours, research methods, and global challenges. Admission requires completion of a polytechnic diploma with strong academic performance, and approximately 120 places are available for international students. I chose this programme because it equips me with the sociological knowledge and research expertise necessary to evaluate accessibility needs and contribute to inclusive policy-making.

Another pathway is the **WSQ GSTC Accessible and Inclusive Travel** course offered by **NTUC LearningHub**. This programme trains participants to implement accessible and inclusive practices in tourism and travel services, covering accessibility standards, inclusive service design, and practical solutions for diverse travellers. Any Singaporean above 21 can apply for this course, and I chose this as it combines my existing knowledge on the tourism industry alongside what I want to learn about accessibility.

By combining a sociology degree with professional SkillFuture backed training, I will be more prepared to advocate for inclusivity, and create equitable experiences in tourism and public services.
