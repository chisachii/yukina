Based on the tools I have attempted to use during CPP, I was percieved as an ISTJ type, and in the My Careers Future quizzes I was labelled someone who had a high ability to do something realistic, and conventional. It defined me as someone judgemental, someone who was calculative in every step.

However, I digress. I personally do not see myself as somebody like that, and I refuse to let quiz results on the screen define me as such. Sure, I may be suited for more challenging, logical jobs. But that doesn't mean it's what I enjoy. I'm not the kind of person who relies on tests or quizzes to tell me what I can, or cannot do.

Just because I am more inclined to numbers, and just because I am naturally inquisitive, does not mean I have to pursue something in STEM. Just because I cannot draw, or that I lack creativity, or that I wouldn't want to interact with many people, doesn't mean I cannot pursue a job helping others.

It may be true that I have strengths in logical reasoning or structured tasks, this does not automatically determine what I enjoy or the type of career I should pursue. Reflecting on my values and ethics, I realized that creativity and empathy are important to me. These traits guide my decision-making and how I interact with others, which may not always align with the calculative and stoic image of me presented in the tests.

My interests and passions lie in areas where I can learn, create, or support others - these include problem-solving, arts, and collaborative projects. My aspirations are to find work that challenges me while making a positive impact on those around me in a way that incorporates my love for arts. 

Considering KSAOs, I recognize my strengths are in analytical thinking and research. “Others” in KSAOs also play a significant role in shaping my potential career path. Certifications such as my Food Hygene Certificate, or even my music gradings have played a larger part in determining part time jobs as well as my future career choices.

Overall, the assessments offered insights into potential patterns in my behavior and abilities, but I realised that self-reflection, personal growth, and lived experiences matter more than any test. The results are a reference but they do not define me, and I aim to pursue opportunities that align with both my strengths and my passions.
