Through my reflection, I have realized that my core values curiosity, integrity, and a desire to help others, shape both how I see myself and how I want to engage with the world. These values guided my decision to pursue Tourism and Resort Management at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, and also shape the way I am. I wasn't initially drawn to any of the career choices offered, but rather being able to learn how to create experiences that connect people, inspire learning, and make others feel valued and supported.

I am here because I want to use my curiosity and organizational skills to bring meaningful experiences to others. Tourism is more than sightseeing and attractions, I believe that it's' about creating environments where people feel welcome, cared for, and understood. I aspire to work in in a job where I can combine practical problem-solving with empathy, ensuring that every guest or participant has a positive, memorable experience. Everyone deserves to have a good time.

I can make a difference with my values by approaching challenges and interactions ethically and thoughtfully. By acting with integrity, showing empathy, and applying my skills creatively, I can contribute to services and experiences that genuinely improve people’s lives. Even small actions such as listening to clients and anticipating their needs reflect my commitment to making a meaningful impact to the world.

I have always been invested in tourism as a concept since young. I often went to different places like the Peranakan Museum, Emerald Hill, or Sentosa every week with my parents, and took every one of those opportunities as a learning experience. And as someone who was Peranakan and grew up mostly in Melakka, Jonker Street called to me.

I want to grow into a professional who can blend knowledge, passion, and values to make leisure and entertainment a way to bring joy, connection, and positive change to others.
