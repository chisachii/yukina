# About me... *!!*

Hey! I'm Rui, better known online as @chisachii. I'm a student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic studying **Tourism and Resort Management**, looking to expand in the arts and culture scene. I grew up with music, arts, and anime, and going to concerts, musicals, as well as conventions have shaped a huge part of who I am. I'm hoping to further my studies in the University of Surrey by studying **Sociology** in **culture** and **inclusivity** there, and to eventually pursue my dreams as an **Accessibility Consultant in Arts & Leisure**.

I believe that every person has the rights to entertainment and enjoyment. No matter if you're able-bodied, or need special arrangements, no one should be deprived of the right to enjoy themselves in spaces such as Theme Parks, Theatres, or even Convention Halls.

I'm fairly involved in the Arts Scene in Singapore, and in my time off you can find me either thrifting at **Haji Lane**, watching yet another **Locally-produced Play**, or at any **Artist Alleys** or **Anime Conventions** in Central Singapore. Other than that I also spend my time either playing RPG games, composing or rearranging music, datamining game assets for public use, or coding websites similar to these.
